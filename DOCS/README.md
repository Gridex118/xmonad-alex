# XMonad-Alex :: XMonad
These are the dots for my XMonad installation, xmonad-alex; so that I can reproduce it easily when
changing systems.

## Installation Dependencies, for the WM
- **git**: If you're here, you probably already have it installed.
- **Haskell**: I recommend you install the all the tools provided under `ghcup`. This configuration
  uses `cabal`, rather than using the `xmonad` package provided by any particular Linux distribution.
  
## UI Applications
- **xmobar**: for the top/status bar
- **picom**: as the compositor; I use the one available in the official Arch Linux *extra* repository.
- **conky**: for resource monitoring
- **nitrogen**: for the wallpaper
- **notification-daemon**: I mean, its in the name
- **redshift**: to not make my eyes hurt
- **unclutter**: to not have to stare at the mouse pointer
- **rofi**: as the application launcher

## Other Applications
- **emacs**: as the text editor
- **alacritty**: as the primary terminal emulator
- **wezterm**: when I wish to see the light
- **firefox**: as the web browser
- **zathura**: as the primary pdf viewer
