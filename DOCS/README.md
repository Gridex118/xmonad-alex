# Alex :: XMonad
These are the dots for my XMonad installation, xmonad-alex.

## Installation Dependencies, for the WM
- **git**: If you're here, you probably already have it installed.
- **Haskell**: I recommend you install the all the tools provided under `ghcup`. This configuration
  uses `cabal`, rather than using the `xmonad` package provided by any particular Linux distribution.
